Complex Game System - Audio Programming
You will need to load a song before clicking the play button.
The old way of loading seemed to only work in the debug mode.
It used to load using "..bin/audio/song name.mp3" but that didn't work on release.
So now you need to use the full file directory including the song name and .mp3, mp4, etc.
So now you could put the audio files u want to test in the music folder and just change the song name "C:/Users/User/Music/song name.mp3"
Once you load a song you can click play to start it.
You can pause and unpause with the same button.
However if you pause and click play it restarts the song.
The float sliders can be used to change the intensity of the music bars.
